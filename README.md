# Pentameter

An open-source poem utility.
After working with C# for a while, I decided that it was time for a Java refresher. This year, we had an English project which required us to write a sonnet. Sonnets are poems that are both intelectually stimulating and meaningful, but sometimes, they get a bit tedious. To address this problem, I decided to write a program, or perhaps just a couple scripts, to do a few checks for me. This includes checking for iambic pentameter, creating outlines, and providing tools for rhyme schemes and other annotations.

## Installation

After a couple useful builds, I will start to post versions onto the, 'Releases,' tab of GitHub. Simply click this tab, and install the .jar file to open up the utility. If you want to compile the project from source, just download the file as a zip or clone the repository, and import it into your IDE of choice.
